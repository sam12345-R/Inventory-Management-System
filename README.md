# Inventory-Management-System

## What the Repository is about?

The repository is about inventory management system where I have a bunch of products and I should perform all the important management features like adding, purchasing, updating, deleting and reporting products.

## Project Description

The Inventory Management System project is part of an internship (Elite Techno Group) where I prompted to deal with a data through the management features CRUD.
Actually, I haven't added that GUI touches yet. It's all about coding skills (I used Python as a programming language).

## Files 

- Records.json: contains all the data I worked on
- Sales.json: This file is part of "purchasing product" feature. It holds all the informations about the products that the user purchased.
- Report.json: This file presents all the reporting informations about any update, purchase, delete, or add happened all over the program.
- ETG_Inventory_Management_System.ipynb: It's where the code exists. I eagerly suggest you to explore the file so that you can further understand the concept.

## Who am I?

I'm currently a 2sd year license student in software engineering at Higher Institute of Computer Science of Mahdia (ISIMa). I love learning about the latest technologies and finding out how to improve my craft. I'm detail oriented and focused. I believe in that quote that says: “I can’t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.”
